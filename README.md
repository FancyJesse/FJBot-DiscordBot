A Discord bot with focus on WWE Matches and includes Chatango and Twitter integration

**Discord Server:** [WatchWrestling](https://discord.gg/Q9mX5hQ)


Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Discord Bot was originally created for a Discord Server in 2017 that focuses on all-things wrestling. It was made with the focus to integrate [WWE Matches](https://fancyjesse.com/projects/wwe) into the Server. This allows Discord Users to bet and rate matches, look up Superstar biographies and birthdays, share gifs, and be alerted on events. In short, enhance the user experience. 

Integration with Twitter and Chatango was later added onto the bot. 

Originally, the bot existed on a single Python file. I had no idea I would be supporting this bot for close to a year or even begin scaling it to include additonal features. With all these additional featues, I decided to transition this Discord Bot project to use COGs. The non-COGs version (very messy) can be found inside the obsolete directory.
